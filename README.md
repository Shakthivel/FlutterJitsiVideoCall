Video Call App

IDEA:

This is a flutter app that makes use of Jitsi SDK to provide free video calls.

SO FAR:

I've implemented google sign in to save time creating a new account. I've used firebase as my database to store uer info like username, email, personal meeting id,etc.

FUTURE WORKS:

i)Design a profile page to display and edit user's info.
ii)Implement reset password using firebase.
iii)Make use of JITSI SDK to provide video call feature.
iv)Get contact list from the user so that the user will be able to send meeting id as sms directly from api.
v)Ablity to share meeting id via whatsapp.
